# Academic-Archive-
The "Academic Archive" is a web-based platform developed to provide university students with easy access to essential academic resources. It allows users to find previous years' exam questions (quiz, mid, final), hand notes prepared by seniors, teachers, or peers, and important notices from the university's official website. The platform is structured into several key sections, including a Home page, Admin panel, Syllabus display, Moderator control, Notice Board, Login/Sign Up, and Contact page. Administrators manage users and documents, while moderators contribute academic resources. The project is developed using HTML, CSS, and PHP, with XAMPP serving as the backend server, offering a comprehensive solution to enhance resource accessibility and academic collaboration.
